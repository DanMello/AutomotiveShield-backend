# What I learned in the Back-end of this project.

1. Learned how to handle file uploads from form data using multer and storing them in the file system with folders categorized by date.

2. Learned how to compress images using JIMP and create thumbnails from videos using ffmpeg

3. Learned how to use json web tokens to authenticate and authorize the user and create sessions using local storage in the front-end.

4. Learned more about querying data with mongoDB, and organizing data by dates.

5. Learned a lot more about organizing my code by combining async await and promises so you don't have to write code with a ton of callbacks.
